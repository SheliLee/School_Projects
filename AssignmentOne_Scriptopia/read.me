In my game you are doing basic tasks, as i have ADHD I though it would be fun to turn my every day into a short rewarding game. It is simple and easy to get though to display how simple the task of the day can be but also the fact that we put in more efffort to get them done that the rewards at the end are just as important as a really big task. 

The game is simple, to reflect the short attention span the commands are in bold within the text for easy understanding, as well as at the top incase the little memory space we posess forgets how to play half way through.
